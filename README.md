# Calender-application

## Project Description

In this project we were given the task to create a calender application that displays typical working hours and allows the user to save a to do task in different times of the calender. The calender application should use the dayjs utility library in order to display the current day and time, and the application is to be writtin using HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.

## How to use
[https://jsen07.github.io/Calender-application/] -- Link to deployed site

## Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/Jquery

The application can be used by clicking on the link to the deployed site. The user will be redirected to the calender application where they are displayed the current day and time, and are presented with a table of boxes that display the working times, along with an input box and a save button. By clicking on an input box the user is able to type a to do task which can saved by clicking on the save button. When the user saves a to do task it will be saved onto the localStorage where the application can re-use the saved data to re-load it back onto the page even when the user exits the application.
