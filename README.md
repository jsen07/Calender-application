# Calender-application

## Project Description

In this project we were given the task to create a calender application that displays typical working hours and allows the user to save a to-do task in different times of the calender. The calender application should use the dayjs utility library in order to display the current day and time. Each time slot should also display a colour to represent the pasy, present and future time eg. (times that have already gone by will be presented with a grey box, whilst times that have not gone by yet will have a green colour, and the current hour wiil have a red coloured box). The application is to be writtin using HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.

## Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/Jquery

## How to use

[https://jsen07.github.io/Calender-application/] -- LINK TO DEPLOYED SITE

The application can be used by clicking on the link to the deployed site. The user will be redirected to the calender application where they are displayed the current day and time, and are presented with a table of boxes that display the working times, along with an input box and a save button. By clicking on an input box the user is able to type a to-do task which can saved by clicking on the save button. When the user saves a to do task it will be saved onto the localStorage where the application can re-use the saved data to re-load it back onto the page even when the user exits the application. 


## Improvements
In the future I would like to add more functionality such as an 'add hour' functionality where the user can add a time which the the application will display the time slots that lead up to that hour. Also, I would like to implement another functionality that lets the user to tick off the tasks that they have completed for that hour time slot which can be done through a button and changes the time slot to a particular colour. e.g(if the task has not been completed for that hour, the box will display a black colour, whilst completed tasks will display a white colour).
